This project is a Spotify-themed music player interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, mimicking the look and feel of Spotifyâ€™s design. The interface allows users to view a list of songs and interact with basic playback controls such as play, pause, forward, and backward.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For the structure of the page.
CSS: For the design and layout, using colors and fonts inspired by Spotify.
JavaScript: (Connected through an external file) For handling interactivity like song play/pause functionality.
